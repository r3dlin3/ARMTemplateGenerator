== What is ARMTemplateGenerator?

ARMTemplateGenerator is a CLI to generate ARM templates. 

It is based on plop. Instead of a ton of parameters, the CLI will ask questions to generate the ARM template and its associated parameter file.

At this moment, only VM templates can be generated (only one plop module).

=== Why create or use ARMTemplateGenerator?

ARM template supports condition or loops however conditions or loops have a number of limitations:

* Loops does not support 0. You must have at least one element.
* In a "if" statement, both statements (in case of true or false) are evaluated, resulting on complex tricks to prevent errors

Moreover, the use of nested templates are too complicated:

* By nature, they need to be uploaded somewhere, which is not as straight forward as Terrform files which are all included
* 2 nested template (one template for NIC with or without public IP for instance) would need to share the same "interface", the same parameters.
What's the point having a public DNS name withtout a public IP?

Finally, VM are quite complex (lots of objects). 
So by using such generator as this one, answering questions on what you want to do, you would be able to have a template following best practices, without to copy-paste template and refactoring for your needs.

== Getting Started

=== Installation
1. Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/r3dlin3/ARMTemplateGenerator

2. Install plop globally

    $ yarn global add plop  
or
    $ npm install -g plop

3. Install dependencies
    $ yarn install
or
    $ npm install

=== Generate a VM ARM template
----
plop VM
----
And answers the question

== Example

And the generated file: 

* link:assets/azuredeploy.json[The ARM template]
* link:assets/azuredeploy.parameters.json[The parameters]

== TODO

* VM: add diagnostic support
* VM: add Azure Key Vault support
* VM: add Backup support
* New module for WebApp (AppInsights, WebTest, AzureCDN, DB?)
